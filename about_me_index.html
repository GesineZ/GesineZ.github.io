                <h2>A long way</h2>
                <h3>Short version of my path so far:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Until 2010: Study of biology, degree: Diploma</li>
                    <li>Becoming mother of a son in 2011 with parental leave</li>
                    <li>From 2014: Working as laboratory assistant</li>
                    <li>Switched to administrative assistance due to 2nd pregnancy in 2015</li>
                    <li>Becoming mother of a girl in 2016 with parental leave</li>
                    <li>Decided to take a job opportunity in Administrative area in small software company</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Diving into code</h3>
                <p>Being inbetween developers was a bit intimidating at the beginning. 
                    But it also remembered me of my very first steps of coding way back in school and encouraged me get a taste of programming again.</p>
